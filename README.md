# Scalable Computation of Shapley Additive Explanations
## Reproducibility

This repository contains the code used for the experiments in my master's thesis about scalable shap value computation.
So far, there is no single "run-and-forget" scripts, but each directory holds the exact scripts used to run the experiments.
